---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

A self-contained (OS X) Kinect development environment based on OpenNI2, NITE2 and
libfreenect.

It contains:
  - A CMake-based build system
  - A copy of OpenNI2-FreenectDriver, a Kinect driver for OpenNI
  - A copy of libfreenect, an open-source library for accessing the Microsoft Kinect USB
    camera
  - A copy of libusb 1.0.8, including an OS X patch made by libfreenect developers

Due to restrictions in their licensing, OpenNI2 and NiTE2 can't be distributed with
FreenectSDK but must be downloaded directly from www.openni.org.


---------------------------------------
- Dependencies
---------------------------------------

You'll need to download OpenNI2 (2.1 or 2.2) and the corresponding NiTE2 version (2.0 or
2.2), decompress them and execute the following commands to copy and configure them to
work with FreenectSDK:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/FreenectSDK>
    FreenectSDK$ ./tools/import_openni2.sh <path/to/OpenNI2>
    FreenectSDK$ ./tools/import_nite2.sh <path/to/NiTE2>

FreenectSDK requires XMake to compile. It is provided as a GIT submodule of this
repository.

To download it, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/FreenectSDK>
    FreenectSDK$ git submodule init
    FreenectSDK$ git submodule update


---------------------------------------
- Compilation
---------------------------------------

(Note: you'll need to install CMake to compile FreenectSDK)

To compile FreenectSDK, do:

    somewhere$ mkdir build
    somewhere$ cd build
    build$ cmake <path/to/FreenectSDK>
    build$ make

The libraries and executables will be put in build/bin/


---------------------------------------
- License
---------------------------------------

Being only a simple set of CMake files, FreenectSDK itself isn't released under a specific
license, feel free to do anything you want with them.

The libraries used by FreenectSDK however are licensed like this:

  - libusb: LGPL 2.1 (see libusb/COPYING)
  - libfreenect: dual licensing Apache 2.0/GPLv2 (see libfreenect/APACHE20 and
                 libfreenect/GPL2)
  - OpenNI2-FreenectDriver: Apache 2.0 (see FreenectDriver/LICENSE)
